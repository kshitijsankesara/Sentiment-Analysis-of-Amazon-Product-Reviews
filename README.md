IST 664: Natural Language Processing Course

For this coursework, I’m analyzing product reviews of Amazon products. The dataset contains close to **143 million reviews** from 1996 to 2014. The data consists of ratings, text reviews, recommendations, and other data consist of product descriptions, category information, price, brand, and Image features. **I successfully analyzed the sentiments of users and divided positive and negative sentiments for each product of Amazon.**
